<div class="textblock"><p>NOTE: If you have a CameraLink interface go to &gt;&gt; <a class="el" href="_instalation_cam_link.html">Installation Instructions - CamLink - Multicam (Euresys)</a></p>
<p>The Pleora eBUS SDK software provides a GEV compatible interface between the camera and a Gigabit network card (10/100/1000), which may already be installed on the host PC.</p>
<p>The network card must be dedicated to the camera system, and NOT shared with an office LAN. If necessary, an additional network card should be installed which can be dedicated for use with the camera.</p>
<p>Any Gigabit network card should work, but cards from the Intel Pro1000 family are recommended by Pleora and are known to work well.</p>
<p>If installing a new network card, ensure that the manufacturer’s drivers (the ones originally supplied with the network card) are installed first before any attempt is made to install the Pleora software. Reboot the PC following installation of a new network card and its manufacturer’s drivers.</p>
<p>Install the Pleora eBUS SDK software by executing ‘ebus_sdk_3.1.3.2846.exe’. The eBUS SDK is first extracted and unzipped, then a window will be generated “Welcome to the InstallShield Wizard for eBUS SDK”. Click ‘NEXT’ and continue with the installation which may take several minutes.</p>
<p>When the installation is finished, it is important to ensure that the correct driver is installed on the network card being used with the camera. To do this, go to:</p>
<p>All programs-&gt;Pleora Technologies Inc-&gt;eBUS SDK-&gt;Tools and then double click on “Driver Installation Tool”.</p>
<p>A window will then be generated showing network cards currently fitted to the PC and the type of driver installed for each. For the network card which is to be connected (dedicated) to the camera, use the dialog controls to replace the Manufacturer Driver with the Ebus Universal Pro Driver. This allows network performance between camera and dedicated network card to be optimised, with network packets delivered directly to the Pleora software rather than via the Window’s network stack.</p>
<p>[The same driver installation dialog can be generated by running "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Pleora\EbDriverTool.exe"]</p>
<p>Having installed Pleora’s Universal Pro Driver on the dedicated network card, REBOOT is required to put the changes into effect.</p>
<p>Please note that the combination of Pleora software and devices should mean that the Windows Firewall does NOT have to be disabled. Pleora software automatically takes the necessary steps to ensure that the network ports used for the camera remain open, even with the firewall in operation.</p>
<p>Next we will set up the IP address for the dedicated network card, please repeat steps below:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Start-&gt;Control panel-&gt;Network Connections</li>
<li>Select the dedicated network card and right click mouse and select properties</li>
<li>Make sure only ‘Internet Protocol’ and ‘Ethernet Bus filter’ are ticked.</li>
<li>Select ‘Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)’ and click ‘properties’. Use the following IP address:<br  />
 4.1. IP address 192.168.101.001 (for example)<br  />
 4.2. Subnet mask 255.255.255.0<br  />
 4.3. Default gateway [leave blank]<br  />
 Note: this step can omitted if the user is happy to have an IP address assigned automatically by the system.<br  />
</li>
<li>Click OK and OK again to close the dialog boxes</li>
<li>REBOOT the machine to put these changes into effect.<br  />
Connect network cable between camera and dedicated network card. Power the camera on.</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of loading the imaging application, Pleora based systems will prompt the user to input the IP address for the camera. The dedicated Gigabit network card has already been assigned an IP address (for example 192.168.101.001 in the example above), and the IP address now entered by the user for the camera must be valid for that subnet e.g. 192.168.101.002</p>
