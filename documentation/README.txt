TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

 * If the CMH does not display any data in the pages, this is due to
   windows not recognising the publisher and unlocking the content.

Workaround:
   A.) Easiest - use 7zip to unzip the API manual.
     or
   B.) If you used windows built in "Extract All" option then follow below steps:
     1. Right click and open "Properties" of the respective .chm file.
     2. On "General" tab at the bottom in "Security" section tick the "Unblock" option.
     3. Click "Apply" and close the Properties window.
     4. Start the CHM and "Happy developing!"
